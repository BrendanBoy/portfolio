            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>I am a web developer based in the Cambridgeshire area.</p>
            <p>I have had a keen interest in technology from an early age: learning to program on Sinclair and Atari machines and building my own computers when that became affordable.</p>
            <p>I took a web design course at a local college and followed this up with three years of study through the Open University, with an emphasis on programming.</p>
            <p>I have always tried to utilise these skills in the workplace, whether it's updating or maintaining the companys website or managing the organisations social media presence.</p>
            <p>The largest project I have worked on to date was as a freelance programmer for Videotel, building test modules for an interactive training package for the maritime industry.</p>
            <p>Following redundancy at the end of 2020 I decided to further pursue my interest in web development, a field that allows me to combine my fascination with technology and my creative flair.</p>
            <p>To further this aim I have been participating in the <a href="scs.php#scs">Scion Coalition Scheme</a>, an intensive training program designed to fully prepare candidates to enter this industry.</p>
